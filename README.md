This is a web application that generates a password based on the answers to the prompts

at least one of the prompts needs to be answered yes in order to return a password.

a length of 8 to 128 is required as well.

fixed problem where selecting 'yes' to each question wouldn't gaurantee atleast one of each selected criteria
